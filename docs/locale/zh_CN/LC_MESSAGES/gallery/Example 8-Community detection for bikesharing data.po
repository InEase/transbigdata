"For bicycle sharing demand, each trip of can be seen as a process from the "
"starting loaction to the end loaction. When we regard the start point and the "
"end point as nodes, and the travel between them as edges, a network can be "
"constructed. By analysing this network, we can get information about the "
"spatial connection structure of the city or the macro travel characteristics "
"of the bicycle sharing demand."
